# Project02-SpaceShooter
This is a simple space shooter game made in Unity for Game Technology class at Indiana University on 9/28/2024.
In the game you control a ship that can be controlled with arrow keys or WASD. Your ship can shoot at asteroids and enemy ships by pressing the space bar, but you must dodge incoming bullets or else your ship will take damage.
## Implementation
* Background image
* Two enemy types--one shoots forwards, the other shoots at the player
* Pixel art made by myself using Aseprite
* Particle effects of destruction of bullets and asteroids
* Auto-scrolling camera
* Rudimentary level design
